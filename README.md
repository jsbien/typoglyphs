# typoglyphs
## An inventory of glyphs used in some 16th century fonts of Polish printers

*Polonia Typographica Saeculi Sedecimi*, published between 1968 and
1981, contains 89 font tables. Scans of these tables have been split
into images of individual glyphs, which were used to reconstruct the
tables in a *LuaLaTeX* document. The images can also be browsed using
the *geeqie* program or a similar tool.
